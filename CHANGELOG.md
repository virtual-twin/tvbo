## 0.2.1 – 2025-11-20
### Changed
- Dependency/test adjustments: skip heavy `tvb` & notebook tests in release workflow; optional deps not required for minimal install.

### Fixed
- Minor packaging workflow refinements preparing for PyPI publish (trusted publishing test exclusions).

### Notes
- Incremental release before broader 1.0.0 stabilization; semantic versioning pre-1.0: minor component changes still bump patch.
