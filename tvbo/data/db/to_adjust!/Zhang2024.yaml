          definition: Pearson correlation between simulated and empirical BOLD signal
        - label: d
          definition: Absolute difference between the means of the empirical and simulated FC matrices to account for scale difference
        - label: KS
          definition: Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance to qualify the dissimilarity between simulated and empirical FCD matrices. KS distance was defined as the maximum distance between the cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) constructed by collapsing the upper triangular entries of simulated and empirical FCD matrices
