label: Tsodyks-Markram Model (Continous-Time Version)
description: |
    The Tsodyks-Markram (TM) model describes short-term synaptic plasticity using differential equations for three variables: excitatory network activity E(t), synaptic depression x(t) for available neurotransmitters, and facilitation u(t) for changes in release probability. This model accounts for physiological responses across cortical synapses by illustrating presynaptic resource depletion and recovery during neural activity.
