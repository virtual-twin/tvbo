# Contributing to TVBO

The Virtual Brain Ontology (TVBO) is a community driven project. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you contribute in a meaningful and efficient way.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

First, you'll need to clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone #insert github link here
```

### Work on the Ontology

You can make changes to the ontology using one of the following ways:

- **Protégé Desktop**: Open the ontology file in [Protégé Desktop](https://protege.stanford.edu/).
- **WebProtégé**: Use [WebProtégé](https://webprotege.stanford.edu/) to edit the ontology online.
- **Code Editor**: If you prefer, you can directly work with the OWL file using a code editor that supports OWL syntax.

## Submitting a Pull Request

When you're ready to submit your changes, here's the process to follow:

1. **Stage your changes**: Only stage the changes that are relevant to the data you are adding or the issue you are fixing.

2. **Create a Meaningful Commit**: Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message. This should clearly explain what has been done.

3. **Create a Branch**: Create a branch for your update. This makes it easier for our maintainers to understand and review your contribution. Please give the branch a meaningful way.

4. **Push to Your Fork**: Push the changes to your fork of the repository.

5. **Start a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to the original TVBO repository and click on the "New Pull Request" button. Make sure to describe your changes clearly, why they are necessary, and how they fit into the existing codebase. If you have used references please add them here.

6. **Follow Good PR Practices**:
   - Make sure the PR is concise and only addresses one issue.
   - Include any necessary documentation or tests.
   - Respond to our review feedback - in case it comes up - in a timely manner.

7. **Submit the Pull Request**: Click the "Create pull request" button to submit your PR.
