description: 'The Hopfield neural network is a discrete time dynamical system composed
  of multiple binary nodes, with a connectivity matrix built from a predetermined
  set of patterns. The update, inspired from the spin-glass model (used to describe
  magnetic properties of dilute alloys), is based on a random scanning of every node.
  The existence of a fixed point dynamics is guaranteed by a Lyapunov function. The
  Hopfield network is expected to have those multiple patterns as attractors (multistable
  dynamical system).

  When the initial conditions are close to one of the ''learned'' patterns, the dynamical
  system is expected to relax on the corresponding attractor. A possible output of
  the system is the final attractive state (interpreted as an associative memory).


  Various extensions of the initial model have been proposed, among which a noiseless
  and continuous version [Hopfield 1984] having a slightly different Lyapunov function,
  but essentially the same dynamical properties, with more straightforward physiological
  Interpretation. A continuous Hopfield neural network (with a sigmoid transfer function)
  can indeed be interpreted as a network of neural masses with every node corresponding
  to the mean field activity of a local brain region, with many bridges with the Wilson
  Cowan model [WC_1972].


  Note:

  - This model uses the modifications implemented by Golos et al. (2015).'
