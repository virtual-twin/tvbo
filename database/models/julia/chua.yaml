description: |-
  This is a 3D continuous system that exhibits chaos.

  Chua designed an electronic circuit with the expressed goal of exhibiting
  chaotic motion, and this system is obtained by rescaling the circuit units
  to simplify the form of the equation. [^Chua1992]

  The parameters are a, b, m0, and m1. Setting a = 15.6, m0 = -8/7 and m1 = -5/7, and
  varying the parameter b from b = 25 to b = 51, one observes a classic period-doubling
  bifurcation route to chaos. [^Chua2007]
