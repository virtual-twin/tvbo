description: |-
  The famous Lotka-Volterra model is a simple ecological model describing the interaction
  between a predator and a prey species (or also parasite and host species). It has been
  used independently in epidemics, ecology, and economics. The prey (x) grows
  exponentially in absence of predators; predation converts prey into predator growth;
  predator (y) declines without prey. Default parameters produce sustained oscillations.
