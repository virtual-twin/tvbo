  This three-dimensional continuous system is due to Rössler [^Rössler1976]. It is a
  system that by design behaves similarly to the Lorenz system and displays a strange
  attractor. However, it is easier to analyze qualitatively, as for example the attractor
  is composed of a single manifold. Default values are the same as the original paper.
