description: "The Wilson and Cowan model consists of two populations or masses, one\
  \ excitatory and one inhibitory, that are described by their mean firings rates\
  \ E and I respectively (Wilson and Cowan, 1972, 1973). \n\nThis model is the minimal\
  \ representation of a NMM with a coarse-grained description of the overall activity\
  \ of a large-scale neuronal network, as opposed to being a detailed biophysical\
  \ model. While employing just two differential equations, it has been used to build\
  \ various biophysically realistic models (Liley et al., 1999; Daffertshofer and\
  \ van Wijk, 2011). \n\nKey parameters in the model are the strength of connectivity\
  \ between each subtype of population (excitatory and inhibitory) and the strength\
  \ of input to each subpopulation. The Input parameters P and Q also provide the\
  \ entry point for local and long-range connectivity, that is, the activity coming\
  \ from neighboring and distant populations respectively.\n\nVarying Input and connectivity\
  \ generates a diversity of dynamical behaviors that are representative of observed\
  \ activity in the brain, like multistability, oscillations, traveling waves and\
  \ spatial patterns.\nWe consider the transmission parameters of the excitatory population\
  \ to be glutamatergic and therefore to be modified by glutamatergic receptors. The\
  \ inhibitory population is considered as GABAergic.\n\nNote:\n- Equations and parameter\
  \ names are taken from (Wilson and Cowan, 1972 and Sanz-Leon et al., 2015)\n- Default\
  \ parameters are taken from Fig. 4 p.10 (Wilson and Cowan, 1972)\n- The model in\
  \ Sanz-Leon et., 2015 includes more parameters than the original model, which can\
  \ be traced in the description of the parameters."
