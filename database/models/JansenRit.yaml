description: 'The Jansen-Rit is a neurophysiologically-inspired neural mass model
  of a cortical column (or area), developed to simulate the electrical brain activity,
  i.e., the electroencephalogram (EEG), and evoked-potentials (EPs; Jansen et al.,
  1993; Jansen & Rit, 1995). It is a 6-dimensional, non-linear, model describing the
  local average states of three interconnected neural populations: pyramidal cells
  (PCs), excitatory and inhibitory interneurons (EINs and IINs), interacting through
  positive and negative feedback loops. The main output of the model is the average
  membrane potential of the pyramidal cell population, as the sum of the potential
  of these cells is thought to be the source of the potential recorded in the EEG.'
